TO DO LIST:
1) farmgood form if statement (editing or new)- 
2) in rails more backend, days available for farmgood, then checkboxes in farmgood form
3) users - farmer and customer inherit login but have different methods
4) proptypes
5) what else?

QUESTIONS:
1) how to fix this:
error: object file .git/objects/dd/a3af7a4d7c40ffea7b6c6d3875a94ee1035bf9 is empty
error: object file .git/objects/dd/a3af7a4d7c40ffea7b6c6d3875a94ee1035bf9 is empty
fatal: loose object dda3af7a4d7c40ffea7b6c6d3875a94ee1035bf9 (stored in .git/objects/dd/a3af7a4d7c40ffea7b6c6d3875a94ee1035bf9) is corrupt

2) Better to have conditional statements re: state in one file or separate files?
